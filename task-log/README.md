# Task Log Directory

This directory contains the implementation progress and task tracking for the project.

## Directory Structure

```
task-log/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completed/  # Completed task records with implementation details
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ current/    # Active tasks and immediate priorities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ next/       # Upcoming tasks and future plans
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes/      # Development guidelines and best practices
```

## Task Status Indicators

Tasks are tracked with clear status indicators:

- ‚úÖ Completed
- üöß In Progress
- üìÖ Planned
- ‚≠ê Priority

## File Naming Convention

- Use the following format for task logs: `[num]-task-[unique-task-name].md`
  - Example: `01-task-setup-tailwind.md`
  - Example: `02-task-add-eslint.md`
- For completed tasks, include date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD-[task-name].md`
  - Example: `2024-03-08-initial-setup.md`

## Task Log Format

Each task log file must include:

1. **Task Name**: A descriptive and unique name
2. **Task Description**: Brief explanation of what the task accomplished
3. **Files or Configurations Changed**: Detailed list of all files created, modified, or deleted
4. **Project Tree Before and After**: Directory structure snapshots using `ls -R` output
5. **Timestamp**: Exact date and time of completion
6. **Status and Completion**:
   - Status: "In Progress" or "Complete"
   - Completion checklist (tests, documentation, code review)

### Example Task Log Format
