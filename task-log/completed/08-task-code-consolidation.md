# Task: Code Consolidation

## Description

Consolidated model and schema imports through a centralized models package to improve code organization and maintainability. All model-related code (both Django models and Pydantic schemas) is now accessed through a single entry point.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `apps/backend/chat/models/__init__.py` to expose both Django models and schema classes
2. Modified `apps/backend/chat/models.py` to re-export everything from models package
3. Ensured backward compatibility by maintaining existing import paths
4. Verified and updated all import statements across the codebase

## Files Changed

- Modified: `apps/backend/chat/models/__init__.py`

```python
from .chat.session import ChatSession, Message, ToolExecution
from .chat.schema import ChatResponse, ToolResult, ChatDependencies

__all__ = [
    'ChatSession',
    'Message',
    'ToolExecution',
    'ChatResponse',
    'ToolResult',
    'ChatDependencies'
]
```

- Modified: `apps/backend/chat/models.py`

```python
from .models import (
    ChatSession,
    Message,
    ToolExecution,
    ChatResponse,
    ToolResult,
    ChatDependencies
)

__all__ = [
    'ChatSession',
    'Message',
    'ToolExecution',
    'ChatResponse',
    'ToolResult',
    'ChatDependencies'
]
```

## Import Structure

- All imports now go through `models.py`
- Example: `from .models import ChatSession, Message, ChatResponse`
- This provides a clean, single entry point for all model-related code

## Benefits

1. Better code organization with related functionality grouped together
2. Simplified imports through a single entry point
3. Easier maintenance and updates
4. Clear separation between Django models and Pydantic schemas while maintaining logical grouping

## Status

- [x] Models package updated
- [x] Import paths consolidated
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] Documentation updated
