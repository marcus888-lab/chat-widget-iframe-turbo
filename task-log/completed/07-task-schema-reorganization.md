# Task: Schema Reorganization

## Description

Moved schema.py content into the models directory to better organize related functionality. Schema classes are now located alongside their corresponding Django models.

## Changes Made

2. Moved all schema classes from `apps/backend/chat/schema.py` to the new location
3. Updated imports in `models/__init__.py` to expose schema classes
4. Removed original `schema.py` file

## Files Changed

- Created: `apps/backend/chat/models/chat/schema.py`
